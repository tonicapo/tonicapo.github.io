				<p> Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

				<h1> My <em>other</em> 3 columns article </h1>
				<p> Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

				//http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5145032/whats-the-use-of-array-prototype-slice-callarray-0
				// 				The DOM usually returns a NodeList for most operations like getElementsByTagName.

				// Although a NodeList almost feels like an array, it is not. It has a length property like an array does, and a method item(index) to access an object at the given index (also accessible with the [index] notation), but that's where the similarity ends.

				// So to be able to use the wonderful array methods without rewriting them all for a NodeList, the above line is useful.

				// Another use of converting it to an array is to make the list static. NodeLists are usually live, meaning that if document changes occur, the NodeList object is automatically updated. That could cause problems, if a jQuery object returned to you kept changing right under your nose. Try the following snippet to test the liveness of NodeLists.

				// var p = document.getElementsByTagName('p');
				// console.log(p.length); // 2
				// document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('p'));
				// // length of p changes as document was modified
				// console.log(p.length); // 3
